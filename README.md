## Instructions

Use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/15/view) for self-checking your submission.

Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like `Player` and `Enemy`) or class prototype functions such as `Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions`. Also make sure that the keyword `this` is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon.

## Contributing

This repository is the starter code for _all_ Udacity students. Therefore, we most likely will not accept pull requests.


## Running

You will see something like the following screenshot. After that, use the arrow keys to move the character. Your goal is to make him reach the water side (on the top) without getting hit from any of the beetles. When the player reaches the water side, he starts again from the default position but with the score incremented.
